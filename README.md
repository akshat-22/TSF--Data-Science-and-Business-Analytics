## GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program ) AUGUST,21 

In this Repository I have put upon the various Task completed by me as an Intern at THE SPARKS FOUNDATION in the Data Science and Business Analytics Field under the GRIP AUG'21 program offered by The Sparks Foundation.The  Task are based on implementing various ML Algorithms on the Different Data Sets and also perform data analysis  and make predictions on given data and check and analyze accuracy and various other mathematical paramaters of our model.
 
 The following Task was completed by me :
 ## Task 1- Prediction using Supervised ML
 #### Dataset used:-http://bit.ly/w-data
 In this task a simple Linear regression Algorithm was used to predict the scores of students on the basis of the no. of hours they study per day.
 
 ## Task 2- Prediction using Unsupervised ML
 #### Dataset used;-https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
 In this task I had implemented KNN Algorithm on iris dataset to predict the optimum no. of clusters using Elbow Method and thus also visualize and represent data  using different plots and graphs for better inference on data.
 
 ## Task 6- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
 #### Dataset used;-https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
 In this task I had Created a Decision Tree Classifier  on iris dataset to  visualize it graphically and to predict any new data accordingly.
